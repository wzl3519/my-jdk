/**
 * A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing.
 * Besides basic {@link java.util.Collection Collection} operations,
 * queues provide additional insertion, extraction, and inspection
 * operations.  Each of these methods exists in two forms: one throws
 * an exception if the operation fails, the other returns a special
 * value (either {@code null} or {@code false}, depending on the
 * operation).  The latter form of the insert operation is designed
 * specifically for use with capacity-restricted {@code Queue}
 * implementations; in most implementations, insert operations cannot
 * fail.

 *
 * <p>Queues typically, but do not necessarily, order elements in a
 * FIFO (first-in-first-out) manner.  Among the exceptions are
 * priority queues, which order elements according to a supplied
 * comparator, or the elements' natural ordering, and LIFO queues (or
 * stacks) which order the elements LIFO (last-in-first-out).
 * Whatever the ordering used, the <em>head</em> of the queue is that
 * element which would be removed by a call to {@link #remove() } or
 * {@link #poll()}.  In a FIFO queue, all new elements are inserted at
 * the <em>tail</em> of the queue. Other kinds of queues may use
 * different placement rules.  Every {@code Queue} implementation
 * must specify its ordering properties.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #offer offer} method inserts an element if possible,
 * otherwise returning {@code false}.  This differs from the {@link
 * java.util.Collection#add Collection.add} method, which can fail to
 * add an element only by throwing an unchecked exception.  The
 * {@code offer} method is designed for use when failure is a normal,
 * rather than exceptional occurrence, for example, in fixed-capacity
 * (or &quot;bounded&quot;) queues.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #remove()} and {@link #poll()} methods remove and
 * return the head of the queue.
 * Exactly which element is removed from the queue is a
 * function of the queue's ordering policy, which differs from
 * implementation to implementation. The {@code remove()} and
 * {@code poll()} methods differ only in their behavior when the
 * queue is empty: the {@code remove()} method throws an exception,
 * while the {@code poll()} method returns {@code null}.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #element()} and {@link #peek()} methods return, but do
 * not remove, the head of the queue.
 *
 * <p>The {@code Queue} interface does not define the <i>blocking queue
 * methods</i>, which are common in concurrent programming.  These methods,
 * which wait for elements to appear or for space to become available, are
 * defined in the {@link java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue} interface, which
 * extends this interface.
 *
 * <p>{@code Queue} implementations generally do not allow insertion
 * of {@code null} elements, although some implementations, such as
 * {@link LinkedList}, do not prohibit insertion of {@code null}.
 * Even in the implementations that permit it, {@code null} should
 * not be inserted into a {@code Queue}, as {@code null} is also
 * used as a special return value by the {@code poll} method to
 * indicate that the queue contains no elements.
 *
 * <p><tt>Queue</tt> implementations generally do not define
 * element-based versions of methods <tt>equals</tt> and
 * <tt>hashCode</tt> but instead inherit the identity based versions
 * from class <tt>Object</tt>, because element-based equality is not
 * always well-defined for queues with the same elements but different
 * ordering properties.
